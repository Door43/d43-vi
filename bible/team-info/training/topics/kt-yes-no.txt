====== Is a Term an "Important Term"? ======

Why are some terms labeled as Important Terms, and other are not? To become an Important Term, a word or phrase should have these characteristics:

  - it needs more than a sentence or two in the notes to explain how to translate it accurately
  - it appears often in the Bible, so it is more efficient to link to another page than to keep repeating the explanation in the notes

If a word has a simple definition that an average speaker would be expected to know from a dictionary, it should not be an Important Term. One way to decide if a word is common is to look at the word list below:

  * [[:vi:bible:team-info:training:topics:common-words]]

Words that appear in the lists above are unlikely to become Important terms //unless// they have special biblical or theological significance. However, all words that are //not// in these lists do not automatically qualify as Important Terms either. If we think they are well-known, we will not include them. Term list below contains terms that have specifically been rejected:

  * [[:vi:bible:admin-reports:obe-admin:obe-reject]]

The rule of thumb is that a term should appear “several times” in more than one book in order to be an Important Term. A dozen times in four or more books is preferred. If a term is especially significant and/or very difficult to explain, the threshold is lower.

==== Two Types of OBE Terms ====

There are two types of Important Terms:

  * OBE Key Terms
  * OBE Other Terms

The Key Terms are more significant theologically, and require special care in their translation. Deciding which category is the right place for a term is actually more art than science. In general, "Key Terms" provide more explanation and translation guidance than the "Other Terms."
