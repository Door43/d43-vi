  * **has taken all that was our father’s**  - Laban's sons were exaggerating because they were angry. This could be translated as "has taken so much that belonged to our father." (See: [[vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
  * **Jacob saw the look on Laban's face. He saw that his attitude toward him had changed**  - This is two different ways of saying the same thing. It is used for emphasis. "Jacob noticed that Laban was no longer pleased with him." (See:[[vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]])
