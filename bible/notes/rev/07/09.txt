\v 9 After these things I looked, and there was a huge multitude that no one could count—from every nation, tribe, people, and language—standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands,
\v 10 and they were calling out with a loud voice:
\pi "Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!"
