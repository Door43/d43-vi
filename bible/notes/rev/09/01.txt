\c 9

\v 1 Then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet. I saw a star from heaven that had fallen to the earth. The star was given the key of the shaft leading to the deep and endless pit.
\v 2 He opened the shaft of the deep and endless pit, and a column of smoke went up out of the shaft like smoke from a huge furnace. The sun and the air turned dark by the smoke pouring out of the shaft.
