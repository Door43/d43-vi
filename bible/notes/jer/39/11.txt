\v 12 "Make sure that no one harms him. Take care of him, and do for him whatever he requests you to do."
\v 13 So he and Nebushazban, who was one of their chief officers, and Nergal-Sharezer the king's advisor, and other officers of the king of Babylon
\v 14 sent some men to bring me out of the courtyard outside of the palace. They took me to Gedaliah who was the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. Then Gedaliah took me to my home, and I stayed in Judah among my own people \add who had been allowed to remain there\add*.

\v 11 Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had given an order about Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the king's bodyguards. He had said,
\v 12 “Take him and care for him. Do not harm him. Do for him anything he tells you.”
\v 13 So Nebuzaradan captain of the king's bodyguards, Nebushazban the high eunuch, Nergal Sharezer the high official, and all the most important officials of the king of Babylon sent men out.
\v 14 Their men took Jeremiah from the courtyard of the guard and entrusted him to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, to take him home, so Jeremiah stayed among the people.
