\v 24 These people also had to drink it: all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of people of mixed heritage who live in the wilderness;
\v 25 all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;
\v 26 all the kings of the north, the ones close by and the ones far away—everyone with his brother and all the kingdoms of the world that are on the surface of the earth. Finally the king of Babylon will drink after them all.”
