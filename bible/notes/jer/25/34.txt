\q
\v 34 Wail, shepherds, and shout for help! Roll about on the ground, you majestic people in the flock.

\q
\v 35 Refuge for the shepherds is gone; there is no escape for the majestic ones in the flock.
\q 
\v 36 There are the distressed cries of the shepherds and the wails of the majestic ones in the flock,
\q for Yahweh is devastating their pastures.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **shepherds**  - In this passage, the shepherds of the people are not good shepherds. They are the ones who are opposing Jeremiah. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
  * **Roll about on the ground **  - a sign of sorrow, mourning or utmost distress
  * **majestic people**  - the stongest and wealthiest leaders
  * **majestic ones**  - the strongest and wealthiest
  * **You will fall like chosen rams.**  - The UDB translates this "like a fragile vase" which is closer to the Hebrew. However, it is difficult to see how fragile vases fit in with shepherds and flocks.
