<usfm>
\q
\v 29 So why  do you accuse me of doing wrong? All of you have sinned against me"—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q
\v 30 "I have punished your people in vain; they would not accept discipline.
\q Your sword has devoured your prophets like a destructive lion!
\q
\v 31 You who belong to this generation! Pay attention to my word, the word of Yahweh! Have I been a wilderness to Israel?
\q Or a land of deep darkness? Why would my people say, 'Let us wander around. We will not go to you anymore'?
