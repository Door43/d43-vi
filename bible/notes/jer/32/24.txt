\v 24 And now, \add the army\add* of Babylonia has built ramps up against our city walls \add in order to attack our city\add*. Because of our enemies' swords and because of famines and diseases, they will be able to conquer it easily. The things that you said would happen have now happened.
\v 25 And it is evident that the Babylonian army will soon conquer this city. So now, Yahweh my Lord, \add I do not understand\add* why you told me to buy this field with my silver, while others were watching. \add It seems that I have just been wasting my money by doing that\add*!"

\v 24 Look! The siege mounds have reached up to the city to capture it. For because of 
sword, famine, and plague, the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. For what you have said would happen is happening, and see, you are watching.
\v 25 Then you yourself said to me, “Purchase a field for yourself with silver and have witnesses witness it,' even though this city is being given into the hand of the Chaldeans.”’”
