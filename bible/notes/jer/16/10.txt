\v 10 When you tell these things to the people, they will ask, 'Why has Yahweh declared that these terrible things will happen to us? What have we done \add for which we deserve to be punished like this\add*? What sin have we committed against Yahweh our God?'
\p
\v 11 Then this is what you must tell them that I am replying to them: 'It is because your ancestors turned away from me, Yahweh. They worshiped other gods and served them. They abandoned me and did not obey my commands.

sin that we sinned against Yahweh our God?’

  * **What is our iniquity and sin that we sinned **- "Iniquity" and "sin" are used together with the word "sinned" to emphasize the wrong that the people have done.
  * **Yahweh's declaration**  - See how you translated this in 1:8.
  * **went after**  - " pursued"
  * **worshiped and bowed down**  - These two terms mean the same thing and are used together for emphasis. (See : Doublet)
