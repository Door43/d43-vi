\v 14 Therefore see! The days are coming"—this is Yahweh’s declaration—"when it will no longer be said, ‘As Yahweh lives, the one who brought up the people of Israel from the land of Egypt.’
\v 15 For as Yahweh lives, the one who brought up the people of Israel from the land of the north and from the lands where he had scattered them, I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their ancestors.
