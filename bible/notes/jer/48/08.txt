\q
\v 8 For the destroyer will come to every city; no city will escape.
\q So the valley will perish and the plain will be devastated, as Yahweh has said.
\q
\v 9 Give wings to Moab, for she must certainly fly away.
\q Her cities will become a wasteland, where there is no one to live in them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the valley will perish and the plain will be devastated** - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. Together they are showing that there will be complete destruction. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Give wings to Moab **- Moab is a country and cannot fly. This phrase is suggesting that Moab must quickly get away from the enemy. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **lazy in doing Yahweh's work... May anyone who keeps his sword back from shedding blood be cursed! **- Yahweh has commanded that Moab be destroyed, this makes the people Moab "dedicated to destruction." These two phrase together emphasize the necessity of that destruction. AT: "either kill as I have commanded or you will become just like them and be killed." (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
