\q1
\v 8 What they say \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add injures people like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* poisoned arrows do.
\q1 They say to their neighbors, 'I hope things will go well for you,'
\q2 while they are planning to kill them.
\q1
\v 9 Should I not punish them for doing that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 7 So Yahweh of hosts says this: See, I am about to test them. I will examine them.
\q For how else should I act for the daughter of my people?
\q
\v 8 Their tongue is a sharpened arrow; it speaks unfaithful things.
\q With their mouth they proclaim peace with their neighbors, but with their hearts they lie in wait for them.
\q
\v 9 Should I not punish them because of these things?—this is Yahweh’s declaration—
\q Should I not avenge myself on a nation that is like this?
