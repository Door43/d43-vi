===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **they have still prophesied**  - spoke a message from God (See : [[vi:obe:kt:prophet]]) 
    * **wicked words and corrupt practices**  - In this expression, 'corrupt practices' adds to the phrase 'wicked words' to give it a fuller meaning. This means they had many evil practices. (See : [[vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
