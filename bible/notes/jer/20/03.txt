\v 3 It happened on the next day that Pashur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, “Yahweh has not called your name Pashur, but you are Magor Missabib.
\v 4 For Yahweh says this: 'Behold, I will make you an object of horror—you and all of your loved ones—for they will fall by the sword of their enemies and your eyes will see it. I will give 
all of Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He will make them captives in Babylon or attack them with the sword.
