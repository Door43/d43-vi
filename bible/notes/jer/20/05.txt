===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I will give him all the wealth**  - The pronoun "him" refers to the king of Babylon who was mentioned in verse 4. He represents his nation and so the wealth of the Israelites will not be given only to him but also to the people of Babylon.
  * **all the wealth of this city and all of its riches, all of its precious items and all the treasures of the kings of Judah**  - This reference to the wealth that belongs to the Israelites is repeated four times for great emphasis .Notice also that the word "all" is repeated with each phrase. (See: Doublet)
  * **I will place these things in the hand of your enemies**  - This is a figure of speech which indicates that God will give these treasures to their enemies. (See: Synecdoche)
  * **They will take them and bring them to Babylon**  - The wealth of the Israelites will be taken away from their capital city (Jerusalem) and brought to the capital city of their enemies (Babylon). (See: Doublet)
  * **the inhabitants of your house**  - your family
  * **will go into captivity **- AT: "will be captured"
  * **you will go to Babylon and die there**  - Jeremiah does not tell Pashhur whether he and his family will be murdered in Babylon, or if they will grow old and die there, but he makes it clear that they will never return to their own country again.
