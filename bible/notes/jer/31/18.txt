\v 18 I have heard the people of Israel grieving very much \add and saying to me\add*,
\q2 'You punished us severely,
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* calves are beaten \add by their owners to train them for pulling a plow\add*.
\q1 So bring us back \add to obey\f + \ft Or: worship \f* you again\add*,
\q2 because we are ready to return to you,
\q1 because you alone are Yahweh, our God.
\q1
\v 19 We turned away from you,
\q2 but we repented;
\q1 after you caused us to realize \add that we were guilty\add*.
\q2 We beat our breasts to show that we were very ashamed \f + \ft doublet \f* of the sins that we committed when we were young.'
\q1
\v 20 But I, Yahweh, say this:
\q2 The Israelite people certainly are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* still my dear children \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1 It is often necessary for me to threaten \add to punish\add* them,
\q2 but I still love them.
\q1 That is why I have not forgotten them,
\q2 and I will certainly act mercifully toward them.

\v 18 "I have certainly heard Ephraim sorrowing: 'You punished me, and I have been punished.
\q Bring me back like an untrained calf, and I will be brought back, for you are Yahweh my God.
\q
\v 19 For after I turned back to you, I was sorry; after I was trained, I slapped my thigh in grief.
\q I was ashamed and humiliated, for I have borne the guilt of my youth.'
\q
\v 20 Is not Ephraim my precious child? Is he not my dear, delightful son?
\q For whenever I speak against him, I certainly still call him to my loving mind. In this way my heart longs for him.
\q I will certainly have compassion on him"—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
