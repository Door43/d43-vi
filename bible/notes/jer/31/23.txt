\v 23 Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: "When I bring back the people to their land, they will say this in the land of Judah and her cities: 'May Yahweh bless you, your righteous place where he lives, you holy mountain.'
\v 24 For Judah and all his cities will live together on her. Farmers and shepherds with their flocks be there.

\v 26 After this I awoke, and I realized that my sleep had been refreshing.
