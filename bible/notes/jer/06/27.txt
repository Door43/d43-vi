\q
\v 27 I have made you, Jeremiah, a refiner of my people, so you will inspect and test their ways.
\q
\v 28 They are all the most stubborn of people, who go about slandering others.
\q All of them are bronze and iron, acting corruptly.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.
    * **a refiner of my people**  - "a person who will test my people." Yahweh is comparing Jeremiah to a person who test silver to find out how pure it is. The people are like the silver that Jeremiah is testing and their sins are the impurities in the silver. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
    * **will inspect** - "will discover"
    * **their ways** - AT: "the things that they do." (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **who go about slandering others** - "and constantly slander other people"
    * **bronze and iron** - Neither of these metals are the silver that Yahweh wants. Silver represents the righteousness that Yahweh desires. AT: "impure and wicked." 
    * **The bellows are scorched by their fire; the lead is consumed in their flame** - The fire that refines the silver is so hot that it burns the bellow. A refiner adds lead to silver ore in order to draw out impurities, but the refiner has run out of lead. These phrases emphasized that the refiner is working very hard to refine the silver.
    * **They keep on refining themselves** - "The refiner continues to refine"
    * **for the evil is not removed** - AT: "because the bad parts do not go away." (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **They will be called "rejected silver,"** - AT: "People will call them 'worthless silver'."
