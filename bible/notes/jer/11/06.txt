====== Jeremiah 11:6-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Then Yahweh said to me, "Go into the streets of Jerusalem and to the other cities in Judah. Proclaim my message to the people. Tell them to listen to the agreement \add that I made with their ancestors\add* and to obey it.
\v 7 When I brought their ancestors out of Egypt, I solemnly pleaded with them many times to obey me, and I am still pleading with them now.
\v 8 But they did not obey me or even pay any attention to me. Everyone continued to be stubborn and to do the evil things that they wanted to do. I commanded them to do what was written in the agreement, but they refused. So I punished them in all the ways that I promised that I would."

\p
\v 6 Yahweh said to me, ‘Proclaim all these things in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. Say, “Listen to the words of this covenant and carry them them out.”
\v 7 For I have been solemnly commanding your ancestors from the day I brought them up from the land of Egypt until this present, persistently warning them and saying, “Listen to my voice.”
\v 8 But they did not listen or pay attention. Each person walked in the stubbornness of his wicked heart. So I brought all the curses in this covenant that I commanded to come against them. But the people still did not obey.'"
