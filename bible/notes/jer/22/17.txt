<usfm>
\v 17 But there is nothing in your eyes and heart except worry for your unjust profit and for pouring out innocent blood,
\q for producing oppression and crushing of others.
\v 18 Therefore Yahweh says this about Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah: They will not lament for him with “Woe, my brother!” or “Woe, my sister!” They will not lament him with 
“Woe, lord!” or “Woe, majesty!”
\q
\v 19 He will be buried with an donkey's burial,
\q dragged away and thrown out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
