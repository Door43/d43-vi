\v 7 So now Yahweh, the God of hosts and the God of Israel, says this: Why are you doing great wickedness against yourselves? Why are you causing yourselves to be cut off from among Judah—men and women, children and babies? No remnant of you will be left.
\v 8 By your wickedness you have offended me with the deeds of your hands, by burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you are going to live. You are going there so that you will be destroyed and be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why are you doing great wickedness against yourselves? Why are you causing yourselves to be cut off from among Judah—men and women, children and babies?**  - Irony is found in these questions in that they are a remnant who have survived the destruction of Judah yet they continue their disobedient ways that will result in their destruction. AT: "You do evil things against yourselves. You cause yourselves to be cut off from the rest of Judah-men and women, children and babies" (See: Irony and [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **By your wickedness you have offended me with the deeds of your hands, by burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you are going to live. You are going there so that you will be destroyed and be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth.**  - AT: "You make me angry with the things you do, by making offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to live. As a result, all the people of the nations of the earth will hate and curse you" (See: Active - Passive and Synecdoche)
