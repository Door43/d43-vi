\v 9 But as for a widow or a divorced woman, everything by which she has bound herself will remain in force against her.
\v 10 And if a woman in her husband’s family makes a vow—if she binds herself by a promise with an oath,
\v 11 and her husband hears of it but says nothing to her—if he does not cancel her vow, then all her vows must remain in force. Every promise with which she has bound herself remains in force.
