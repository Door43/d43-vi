\v 23 The Levites must do the work connected to the tent of meeting. They will be responsible for any sin regarding it. This will be a permanent law throughout your people’s generations. And among the people of Israel they must have no inheritance.
\v 24 For the tithes of the people of Israel, which they offer as a presented offering to me—it is these that I have given to the Levites as their inheritance. That is why I said to them, ‘They must have no inheritance among the people of Israel.' "
