\v 8 Yahweh also said to Aaron, "I myself have appointed you to take care of all the sacred offerings that the Israelite people bring to me. I have given all these sacred offerings to you and to your sons. You and your descendants will get a share of these offerings permanently.
\v 9 The parts of the offerings that are not completely burned on the altar belong to you. Those parts of the sacred offerings, including the grain offerings, the offerings to make atonement for sins and to remove the guilt of sins, are set apart, and are to be given to you and your sons.

\v 8 Then Yahweh said to Aaron, "Look, I have given you the duty of handling the offerings raised up to me, and all the holy offerings that people of Israel give to me. I have given these offerings to you and your sons as your ongoing share.
\v 9 These things from the most holy offerings that are not completely burned up will be yours. Every sacrifice the people bring, including every grain offering, every sin offering, and every guilt offering—all these very holy offerings —that they reserve for me and bring to me will be for you and for your sons.
