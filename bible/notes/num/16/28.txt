\v 28 Then Moses said, "By this you will know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works, forI have not done them of my own accord.
\v 29 If these men die a natural death such as normally happens, then Yahweh has not sent me.
\v 30 But if Yahweh creates an opening in the ground that swallows them up like a large mouth, along with all their families, and if they go down alive into Sheol, then you must understand that these men have despised Yahweh."
