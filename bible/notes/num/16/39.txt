\v 39-40 Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers that had been used by the men who were burned up. He hammered them out as a covering over the altar, as Yahweh had spoken to him through Moses. They would become a reminder to the people of Israel, so that no person not a descendant of Aaron would come up to burn incense before Yahweh. In this way, such a person would not become like Korah and his group.
