\v 11 You know how to give good things to your children, even though you are evil. So God, your Father who is in heaven, will even more certainly give good things to those who ask him.


\p
\v 12 So in whatever way you want others to act toward you, that is the way you should act toward them, because that is the meaning of God's Law and of everything that the prophets wrote long ago.

and the prophets.
