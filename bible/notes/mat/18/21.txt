===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach about repentance and forgiveness.

  * **seven times** - "7 times" (See: [[vi:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **seventy times seven** - Possible meanings: 1) "70 times 7" (ULB) or 2) "77 times" (UDB). If using a number would be confusing, you can say, "more times than you can count" (see UDB and [[vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]).
