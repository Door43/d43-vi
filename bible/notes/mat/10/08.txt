===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus sending out his twelve apostles to do his work that began in [[:vi:bible:notes:mat:10:01|10:1]].

  * **you...your** - the twelve apostles
  * **Acquire no gold, silver, nor brass** - "Do not acquire gold, silver, or brass"
  * **Acquire** - "Get," Receive," or "Take"
  * **gold, silver, nor brass** - These are metals out of which coins were made. This list is a metonym for money, so if the metals are unknown in your area, translate the list as "money" (see UDB).
  * **purses **- This means "belts" or "money-belts," but it can refer to whatever might be used to carry money. A belt is a long strip of cloth or leather worn around the waist. It was often wide enough that it could be folded and used to carry money.
  * **traveling bag **- This could either be any bag used to carry things on a journey, or a bag used by someone to collect food or money.
  * **two tunics** - Use the same word you used for "tunic" in [[:vi:bible:notes:mat:05:40|5:40]].
  * **laborer**  - "worker"
  * **food** - "what he needs"
