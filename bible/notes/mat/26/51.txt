\v 51 Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the servant of the 
high priest, and cut off his ear.
\v 52 Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the
sword.
\v 53 Do you think that I could not call upon my Father, and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels?
\v 54 But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled, that this must happen?"
