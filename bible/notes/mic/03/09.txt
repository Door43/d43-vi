\q
\v 9 Now listen to this,
\q you leaders of the house of Jacob,
\q and rulers of the house of Israel,
\q you who detest justice,
\q and pervert everything right.
\q
\v 10 You build Zion with blood
\q and Jerusalem with iniquity.
\q
\v 11 Your leaders judge for a bribe,
\q your priests teach for a price,
\q and your prophets do divination for money.
\q Yet you rely on Yahweh and say,
\q "Is not Yahweh with us?
\q No evil will come on us."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You build Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity**  - The rich were building themselves beautiful homes often at the expense and mistreatment of the poor. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **blood **- Here "blood" refers to murder. (See: [[vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] )
  * **Is not Yahweh with us? No evil will come to us.**  - Micah quotes the leaders who wrongly think Yahweh would not punish them for their sinful deeds. The Hebrew word for "evil" here is the same as for "disaster" in 2:3, a key word in the book. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
