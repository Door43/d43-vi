\v 31 He said to Jeroboam, "Take ten of these pieces for yourself, because Yahweh, the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, says to you, 'I am going to tear the kingdom from Solomon, and I am going to enable you to become the ruler of ten of the tribes \add of Israel\add*.
\v 32 Solomon's \add descendants\add* will still rule one tribe \f + \ft Or: two tribes \f*, because of \add what I promised\add* David, a man who served me \add very well\add*, and because of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen from all the cities in Israel \add to be the city where my people will worship me\add*.
\v 33 I am going to do this because Solomon has rejected me and has been worshiping Astarte, the goddess that the people of Sidon worship, Chemosh, the god that the Moab people-group worship, and Milcom, the god that the Ammon people-group worship. He has not conducted his life as I wanted him to. He has not obeyed my statutes and laws, like his father David did.

\v 31 He said to Jeroboam, "Take ten pieces, for Yahweh the God of Israel says, 'Look, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and I will give ten tribes to you
\v 32 (but Solomon will have one tribe, for my servant David’s sake and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city that I have chosen out of
all the tribes of Israel),
\v 33 because they have forsaken me and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab,
and Milcom the god of the people of Ammon. They have not walked in my ways, to do what is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my decrees, as did David his father.
