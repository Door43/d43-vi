\v 20 As they sat at the table, the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who had brought him back, 
\v 21 and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, "Yahweh says, 'Because you have been disobedient to the word of Yahweh and have not kept the command that Yahweh your God gave you,
\v 22 but came back and have eaten food and drunk water in the place about which Yahweh told you to eat no food and drink no 
water, your body will not be buried in the tomb of your fathers.'"
