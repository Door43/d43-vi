\v 7 And now, Yahweh my God, you have made your servant king in the place of David my father, though I am only a little child. I do not know how to go out or come in.
\v 8 Your servant is in the midst of the people whom you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to be numbered or counted.
\v 9 So give your servant an understanding heart to judge your people, so that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of yours?"
