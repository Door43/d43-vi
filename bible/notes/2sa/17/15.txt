\v 15 Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, "Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of
Israel in such and such a way, but I have advised something else. 
\v 16 Now then, go quickly and report to David; say to him, 'Do not camp tonight at the fords of the Arabah, but by all means cross over, or the king will be swallowed up along with all the people who are with him.'"
