===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **We have a little sister…marriage? **- In the culture where this was written, young girls were promised to a man's family long before the actual time of the marriage. The young girl's family had a responsibility to guard and protect her, especially from sexual encounters, before she was actually married. AT: "We have a young sister who has been promised as a bride. What can we do to protect her to keep her pure until the time of her marriage?" (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])​
