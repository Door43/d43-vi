===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I would lead you and bring you into my mother's house**  - If the lover were her brother, she could bring him to the family home.
  * **and you would teach me** - Because the woman is inexperienced in making love, she is imagining that he would instruct her. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **I would give you spiced wine to drink and some of the juice of my pomegranates** - Because she loves the man so much, she will give all of herself to him. The "wine" and the "juice" are beautiful and precious just as her body is. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **pomegranates** - See how you translated this in [[vi:bible:notes:sng:04:03|4:3]]. 
  * **His left hand is holding my head, his right hand is embracing me**. - In her imagination, the woman thinks of the comfort and love she and her lover share while lying down together.
