===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I am dark but lovely** - The woman is humbly explaining  the color of her skin.
  * **dark like the tents of Kedar** - The nomadic tribes in Kedar used black goat skins to build their homes. The woman is comparing her skin to these tents. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Kedar** - See how to [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]].
  * **lovely like the curtains of Solomon** - Since Solomon was a king, he would have had beautiful cloth decorating his palace.
  * **Do not stare at me because I am dark…scorched me** - The woman is explaining to the women of the palace that her skin is extra dark because she has been outside so much of the time.
  * **scorched** - "burned" or "blistered"
  * **My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards** - The woman says she was outside so much because of her brothers' selfish reasons which forced her to work outside in the sun.
  * **my own vineyard I have not kept** - The woman seems to be comparing her outward appearance to a vineyard. Because she was made to work outdoors, she has lost her light skin, perhaps thought to be a sign of beauty in that culture. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
