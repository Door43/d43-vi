  * **like a column of smoke** - Because the people raised much dust in the air as they traveled, the dust looked like smoke in the distance. AT: "with columns of smoke going up." (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])

  * **Look** - This word shows here that the speaker now discovers the answer to the question in verse 6.

  * **sixty warriors surround it, sixty soldiers of Israel** - This is repeated for emphasis. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
