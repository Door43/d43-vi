  * [[vi:obe:other:flock]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn ewes** - After sheep have their wool cut off, they are washed and their skin looks very white. This phrase compares the whiteness of the teeth of the woman to the whiteness of sheep after washing. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **flock of newly shorn ewes** - The word "shorn" means their wool was cut off. 
  * **Each one has a twin** - The woman is not missing any teeth.
  * **none among them is bereaved**  - The word "bereaved" means to miss someone because they are gone (usually because of death). This phrase again indicates that none of the woman's teeth are missing. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
