<usfm>
\v 17 When Aaron goes into the Very Holy Place \add in the Sacred Tent\add* to purify it, no one else is permitted to enter \add the other part of\add* the Sacred Tent. Only after Aaron has performed rituals to enable me to forgive him and his family, and all the Israelite people, is any priest permitted to enter the Sacred Tent.
\p
\v 18 Then Aaron must go outside the tent to purify my altar. He must do this by smearing some of the blood from the bull and some of the blood from the goat on each of the projections at the corners of the altar.
\v 19 Then Aaron must dip his finger into the \add basin of\add* blood and sprinkle some of the blood over the altar seven times. By doing that, he will cleanse it from being unholy \add because of the sins\add* of the Israelite people, and it will become holy again.

\v 17 No one must be in the tent of meeting when Aaron enters it to make atonement in the most holy place, and until he comes out and has finished making atonement for himself and for his family, and for all the assembly of Israel.
\v 18 He must go out to the altar that is before Yahweh and make atonement for it, and he must take some of the bull's blood and some of the goat's blood and put it on the horns of the altar all around.
\v 19 He must sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse it and consecrate it from the unclean actions of the people of Israel.
