===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues to speak against the false prophetesses in Israel.

  * **handfuls of barley and crumbs of bread** - Barley is a grain used to make bread and the word "crumb" is a small amount of bread. Both phrases are small amounts of food and are used to emphasize how small the payment was to the prophetesses. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
