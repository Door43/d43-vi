===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **perceives** - "discerns" or "identifies" 
    * **all night long her lamp is not extinguished** - This refers to her working long into the night while it is dark. She does not work the entire night, from dusk to dawn, this is an exaggeration. AT: "She burns a lamp through the night as she works" (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **spindle**  - a thin rod or stick with pointed ends that is used in making thread
