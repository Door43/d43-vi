====== Proverbs 26:24-26 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 Those who hate someone and are saying \f + \ft metonymy \f* something very different from what they are thinking are hypocrites;
\q2 in their inner beings they are planning \add to harm that person\add*.
\q1
\v 25 When they say nice things, do not believe them,
\q2 because in their inner beings are many things that \add Yahweh\add* hates.
\q1
\v 26 They try to deceive people to cause them to think that they do not hate that person,
\q2 but in a public meeting, the people will find out the evil things \add that they have done\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 24 The one who is filled with hate, by the words he speaks, he hides his true feelings;
\q2 and he stores up more and more lies within himself;
\q1
\v 25 he may say words of kindness, but you should not believe them,
\q2 because deep within him is everything that God despisesâ€” 
\q1
\v 26 though he covers up his hatred by his lies, 
\q2 everyone sees his wickedness.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 24 One who hates disquises his feelings with his lips,
\q and he lays up deceit within him;
\q
\v 25 he will speak graciously, but do not believe him, 
\q for there are seven abominations in his heart;
\q
\v 26 though his hatred is is covered with deception, 
\q and his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
