\v 22 But perhaps you will say to me, "No, we are relying on\f + \ft Or: trusting in \f* Yahweh our God \add to help us\add*." \add I would reply,\add* "Is he not the one whom \add you insulted by\add* tearing down his shrines and altars and forcing everyone in Jerusalem and \add other places in\add* Judah to worship only in front of the altar \add in Jerusalem\add*?"~'
\p
\v 23 So I suggest that you make a deal between you and my master\f + \ft Or: boss \f*, the king of Assyria. I will give you 2,000 horses, but \add I do not think that\add* you are able to find 2,000 of your men who can ride on them!

\v 22 But if you say to me, 'We are trusting in Yahweh our God,' is not he the one whose shrines and altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem?'
\v 23 Now therefore, I want to make you a good offer from my master the king of Assyria. I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able to find riders for them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Rabshakeh continues talking to Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah (King Hezakiah's men), giving them the message from the king of Assyria.

    * **is not he the one whose shrines and altars Hezekiah has taken away**  - Rabshakeh doesn't understand that Hezekiah obeyed God by tearing down those shrines and altars ([[:vi:bible:notes:2ki:18:04]]) and telling everyone to worship in Jerusalem.
    * **I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able to find riders for them**  - Rabshakeh is bragging about the great power of Assyria by saying that they can give away so many horses and at the same time insulting Judah by saying that they are so weak that they don't even have that many men.
