\p
\v 1 Now in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Joram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria; he reigned twelve years.
\v 2 He did evil in the sight of Yahweh, but not like his father and his mother; for he removed the sacred stone pillar of Baal that his father had made.
\v 3 Nevertheless he held on to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, by which Jeroboam had led Israel into sin. He did not leave from them.
