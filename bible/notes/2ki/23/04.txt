\v 4 The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests under him, and the gatekeepers, to bring out of the temple of Yahweh all the vessels that were made for Baal and Asherah, and for all the stars of
heaven. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields in the Kidron Valley and carried their ashes to Bethel.
\v 5 He removed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had chosen to burn incense at the shrines in the
