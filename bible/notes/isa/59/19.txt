===== Translation Notes: =====

Isaiah continues speaking.

  * **the name of Yahweh**  - Here "name" refers to Yahweh's reputation and character. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **from the west…from the sun's rising**  - Isaiah combines these words to mean people in all places of the world. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism|Merism]])
  * **for he will come as a rushing stream**  - Narrow valleys in Judah were dry most of the year until a sudden, heavy rain turned them into fast-moving water. When that happened there was a lot of noise and wind. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **driven by the breath of Yahweh**  - AT: "which the breath of Yahweh drives" (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
  * **declaration of Yahweh**  - See how you translated this in [[:vi:bible:notes:isa:14:21|14:22]].
