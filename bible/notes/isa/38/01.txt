===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 About that time, Hezekiah became very ill and was close to dying. So I went to see him. And I gave him this message: "This is what Yahweh says: 'You should tell the people in your palace what you want them to do after you die because you will not recover from this illness. You are going to die'~"
\p
\v 2 Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed this:
\v 3 "Yahweh, do not forget that I have always served you faithfully with all my inner being, and I have done things that pleased you!" Then Hezekiah started to cry loudly.

\v 1 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the point of dying. So Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, "Yahweh says, 'Set your house in order; for you will die, not live.' "
\v 2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh.
\v 3 He said, "Please, Yahweh, call to mind how I have faithfully walked before you with my whole heart, and how I have done what was good in your sight." And Hezekiah wept loudly.
