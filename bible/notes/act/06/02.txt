\v 3 So, fellow believers, carefully choose seven men from among you, men whom you know that the Spirit of God directs and who are very wise. Then we will instruct them to do this work.
\v 4 As for us, we will keep on using our time to pray and to preach and teach the message about Jesus."

\v 2 The twelve apostles called the multitude of the disciples to them and said, "It is not right for us to give up the word of God in order to serve tables.
\v 3 You should therefore choose, brothers, seven men from among yourselves, men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
\v 4 As for us, we will always continue in prayer and in the ministry of the word."
