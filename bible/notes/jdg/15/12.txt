\v 12 They said to Samson, “We have come down to tie you up and give you over to the power of the Philistines.” Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.”
\v 13 They said to him, “No, we will only tie you with ropes and hand you to over them. We promise we will not kill you.” Then they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.
