===== Translation Notes: =====

AT: ** 21 ** Then Yahweh touched the meat and bread with the walking stick that was in his hand. A fire flamed up from the rock and burned up everything that Gideon had brought! And then Yahweh disappeared. (TFT) - This is a concept called, "theophany" - in which God appears on earth in the form of a man, or sometimes, an angel. It does not happen often. One must read the context of surrounding verses to know when it is happening.
