\v 48 Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the men who were with him. Abimelech took an axe and cut off branches. He put it on his shoulder and ordered the men with him, “What you have seen me do, hurry and do as I have done.”
\v 49 So every one cut off branches and followed Abimelech. They piled them on top of the underground chamber, and they set it on fire above it, so that all the people of the tower of Shechem also died, about a thousand men and women.
