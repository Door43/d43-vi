\q
\v 7 "How fortunate are the people whose sins God has forgiven, whose sins he no longer looks at. 
v 8 How fortunate are the people whose sins he no longer keeps a record of.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **David also pronounces blessing upon the man to whom God counts righteousness without works** - Alternate translation: "Similarly, David wrote about how God blesses the man whom God makes righteous without works."
  * **whose iniquities are forgiven...whose sins are covered...to whom the Lord will not count sin** - Alternate translation: "whose iniquities the Lord has forgiven...whose sins the Lord has covered...whose sins the Lord will not count" The same concept is stated in three different ways, a doublet extended to a "triplet." (See: [[vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]], [[vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
