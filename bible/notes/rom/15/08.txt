\v 8 I want you to remember that Christ helped us Jews to know the truth about God. That is, he came to make come true everything that God had promised our ancestors that he would do.
\v 9 But he also came to help the non-Jews, so they would praise God for having mercy on them. What he has done made come true what is written in the scriptures that David said to God: "So I will praise you among the non-Jews; I will sing and praise you."

<usfm>
\v 8 For I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision in behalf of the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers,
\v 9 and for the Gentiles to glorify God for his mercy. It is as it is written,
\q "Therefore I will give praise to you among the Gentiles
\q and sing praise to your name."
