  * **other plants will sprout up from the same soil in his place** - Here the writer continues the metaphor from [[vi:bible:notes:job:08:16|08:16-18]]. Godless people are compared to plants that take the place of the first ones that grow among rocks. AT: "When one wicked man dies, another will take his place" or "From the soil, another will grow."

  * **same soil** - "the rocky ground"
  * **in his place** - "in the place of the godless man"
