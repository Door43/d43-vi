===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 If they are very foolish, with the result that they trust in things that are really worthless,
\q2 then things that are worthless will be all that they get.
\q1
\v 32 While they are still young, they will disappear;
\q2 they will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* branches that wither and never become green again.
\q1
\v 33 They will be like \f + \ft simile \f* vines whose grapes fall off before they are ripe,
\q2 like olive trees whose blossoms fall off before they produce any fruit.
