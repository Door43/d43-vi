\q2 and that you are writing down even the bad things I did when I was young.
\q1
\v 27 It is as though you have put my feet in stocks
\q2 and that you were watching me wherever I walk;
\q2 it is as though you were following my footprints to see where I have gone.
\q1

\q2 like a piece of cloth that the larvae of moths are eating.
