\q2 what could I gain from having these men work for me, even when they thought they were strong?

\q
\v 1 Now those who are younger than I have nothing but mockery for me—
\q these young men whose fathers I would have refused to allow to work beside the dogs of my flock.
\q
\v 2 Indeed, the strength of their fathers' hands, how could it have helped me—
\q men in whom the strength of their mature age had perished?
\q
\v 3 They were thin from poverty and hunger;
\q they gnawed at the dry ground in the darkness of wilderness and desolation.
