===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is talking about Israel.

  * **I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me. **- Yahweh knows that Ephraim (Israel) is idolatrous. There is no way that they can worship idols without Yahweh knowing what they are doing. (see: Parallelism and Synecdoche)
  * **for the spirit of adultery is in them**  - //for the spirit of adultery is in them //  can be made explicit: "They have chosen to be unfaithful and immoral" (UDB) (see: Explicit and implicit information)
  * **and they do not know me, Yahweh**. - Israel no longer listens to or follows Yahweh in any way. They do not acknowledge him as their God.
