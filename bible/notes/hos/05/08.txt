  * **Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven: 'We will follow you, Benjamin!' **- Beth Aven was probably on the border between Israel (the northern kingdom) and the tribe of Benjamin (part of the southern kingdom). This could have been a warning to Benjamin or a request for help from Benjamin. (see: metonymy)
