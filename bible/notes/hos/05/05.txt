\q2 because I have abandoned them.
\q1
\v 7 They have abandoned me;

\q1 So \add they will not be able to celebrate\add* their festivals at the new moons

<usfm>
\v 5 Israel is proud; because of this others know how guilty she is.
\q2 The sins that the people of Israel have committed are making them faithless to Yahweh.
\q2 Judah is becoming faithless, too.
\q1
\v 6 They are hoping to persuade Yahweh to have mercy on them.
\q2 They are coming to sacrifice sheep and cattle to him from their flocks and herds
\q1 But they will find that Yahweh will have no mercy on them
\q2 because he has stopped helping them; he is leaving them alone.
\q1
\v 7 They did not keep their promises to Yahweh.
\q2 and they have had children by foreign women.
\q1 So at the time of the new moon festivals, 
\q2 they will perish, together with their cultivated fields.

\v 5 The pride of Israel testifies against him;
\q so Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their guilt;
\q and Judah also will stumble with them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is talking about Israel.

  * **The pride of Israel testifies against him**  - This means that the people of Israel have become proud. They do not feel the need to rely on Yahweh for anything. Their actions show their pride and arrogance ("their actions testify against them"). (see: personification)
  * **so Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their guilt; and Judah also will stumble with them **- All of the nation of Israel (both northern and southern kingdoms) will fall away from Yahweh ("stumble spiritually") because of their sin of idol worship. (see: metaphor)
  * **They will go with their flocks and herds to seek Yahweh**  - Israel will once again try to offer sacrifices to Yahweh from their flocks and herds. (see: metaphor)
  * **but they will not find him, for he has withdrawn himself from them **- Bringing sacrifices to Yahweh will do no good because their sacrifices are worthless now; Yahweh has turned away from them.
  * **They were unfaithful to Yahweh, for they have borne illegitimate children**. - Israel left Yahweh and worshiped idols. In their adultery, children were born - children that were born of parents not married to each other and who did not worship Yahweh.
  * **Now the new moon festivals will devour them with their fields**. - //Now the new moon festivals will devour them with their fields //  can be made explicit: "So at the time of the new moon festivals, they will perish, together with their cultivated fields." (UDB) This means that Yahweh's judgment will come upon them. (see: Explicit and implicit information; also see Personification)
