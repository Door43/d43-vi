===== Translation Notes: =====

God is speaking about Israel.

  * **How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel?** - Yahweh loves his people so much that he will not totally destroy them. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **How can I make you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim?** - AT: "I do not want to act toward you as I acted toward Admah or make you like Zeboiim—cities that I destroyed along with Sodom." (UDB) (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **My heart has changed within me** - The "heart" often represents the will/decisions a person makes. So the "heart" here represents the whole person of God. (UDB) (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
