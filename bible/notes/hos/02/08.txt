<usfm>
\v 8 The people will say this, because they did not know that it was I, Yahweh, who had given them their grain, new wine, and olive oil. 
\q2 It was I who had given them much silver and gold so they would become wealthy.
\q1 But then they made all that gold and silver into objects to use in worshiping the idol Baal.
\q1
\v 9 Therefore I will take away from Israel all the grain I gave them.
\q2 When the wheat is ready for harvest, I will keep them from getting it.
\q1 The new wine that I gave them, I will take it away.
\q2 I will take away from them all the wool and linen I gave them to make clothes for themselves, 
\q1 the clothes that covered their nakedness.

\v 8 For she had not known that it was I who gave her
\q the grain, the new wine and the oil,
\q and who lavished on her silver and gold,
\q which they then used for Baal.
\q
\v 9 So I will take back her grain at harvest time, 
\q and my new wine in its season.
\q I will take back my wool and flax
\q that were used to cover her nakedness.

===== Translation Notes: =====

God is speaking to Hosea.

  * **I will take back my wool and flax that were used to cover her nakedness.** - Israel's harvests would fail.  He would remove his blessings from the nation of Israel and they would again be "naked." (see: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and see how you translated "naked" in [[:vi:bible:notes:hos:02:02|2:3]].)
