===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is talking about Israel.

  * **Ephraim united himself with idols; leave him alone. **- Ephraim has made the choice to worship idols, instead of Yahweh. Ephraim will therefore have to take the consequences of his actions ("leave him alone" to see what will happen).
  * **her rulers dearly love their shame**  - This means that Israel's rulers are NOT ashamed of what they are doing when they worship idols and turn against Yahweh. (see: Litotes)
  * **The wind will wrap her up in its wings**  - The "wind" is symbolic of God's judgment and wrath against the nation of Israel. Yahweh will literally allow Israel to be captured and taken into exile. (see: metaphor and metonymy)
  * **they will be ashamed because of their sacrifices**  - //they will be ashamed because of their sacrifices //  can be made explicit: "Only then will they be ashamed because they gave offerings to the idols." (UDB) (see: Explicit and implicit information)
