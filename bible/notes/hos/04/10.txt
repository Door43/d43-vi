===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:En:obe:other:prostitute]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is talking about Israel.

  * **They will eat but not have enough**  - The pronoun "they" could refer to the priests, or to the people of Israel, or to the nation, or to all of these. The point is that they will never be satisfied or have enough because they do not follow Yahweh. (see: metaphor)
  * **but not increase **- "will not conceive and bear children"
