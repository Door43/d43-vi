<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh says, "When the leaders of Israel spoke, the people trembled;
\q2 they were respected in Israel.
\q1 But because they all worshiped Baal, they became guilty, 
\q2 and they died. 
\q1
\v 2 Now they sin more and more;
\q2 they make cast metal figures out of silver
\q1 to make them their idols.
\q2 Those idols are statues that are very cleverly made,
\q2 but those statues are made only by craftsmen.
\q1 But other people see 
\q2 that the men of Israel sacrifice to these calf-idols and kiss them to worship them.
