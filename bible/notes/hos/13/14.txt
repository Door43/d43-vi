===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.

  * **Will I really rescue them from the power of Sheol? Will I really rescue them from death?** - Yahweh uses these questions to tell the people of Israel that he is not going to save them from dying. They will face punishment for their great wickedness. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Death, where are your plagues? Bring them here. Sheol, where is your destruction? Bring it here** - Yahweh uses these questions to let the people know that judgment is coming upon Israel soon. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Compassion is hidden from my eyes** - Yahweh loves and cares for his people (compassion), but he can no longer allow Israel to go without judgment and punishment. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
