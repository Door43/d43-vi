\v 8 But I decided that I would not eat the kind of food that the king ate, or drink the wine that he drank, because that would make me ritually defiled\f + \ft Or: unacceptable to God \f*. So I asked Ashpenaz to allow me to eat and drink other things.
\v 9 God had caused Ashpenaz to greatly respect me,
\v 10 but he was worried about what I suggested. He said, "My master, the king, has commanded that you eat the kinds of food and drink that he does. If \add you eat other things and as a result\add* you become more thin and pale than the other young men who are your age, he will \add order his soldiers to\add* cut off my head because of what you have done!"

\v 8 But Daniel decided that he would not eat the kind of food that the king ate, or drink the wine that the king drank because that would make him ritually defiled. So he asked Ashpenaz, the chief of the king's officials for permission to eat and drink other food so that he might not defile himself.
\v 9 God gave Daniel kindness and compassion in the relationship he had with Ashpenaz. The chief official had great respect for Daniel.
\v 10 He said to Daniel, "My master the king, has chosen what food and drink you should have. If you eat other things and you become thinner and paler than the other young men who are your age, he could order his soldiers to cut off my head because you did not follow his directions."

\v 8 But Daniel intended in his mind that he would not pollute himself with the kingâ€™s delicacies or with the wine that he drank. So he asked permission from the chief official that he might not pollute himself.
\v 9 Now God gave Daniel favor and compassion through the respect that the chief official had for him.
\v 10 The chief official said to Daniel, "I am afraid of my lord the king. He has commanded what food and drink you should have. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men of your own age? The king might have my head because of you."
