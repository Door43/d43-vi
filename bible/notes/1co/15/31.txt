<usfm>
\v 31 My fellow believers, every day I \add am in danger of\add* being killed \f + \ft Or:people killing me \f*! That is as true as it is that I am pleased with you because of your close relationship with Christ Jesus our Lord.
\v 32 \add If God will not cause us believers to become alive again after we die\add*, I will receive no benefit at all \add from having opposed those who attacked me so strongly\add* in Ephesus \add city\add*.\f + \ft Or: what will I gain \add from having opposed those who attacked me so strongly\add* in Ephesus \add city\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* They were \add fighting me like\add* wild beasts! If we \add believers\add* will not be raised \add from the dead\add* \f + \ft Or:If \add God\add* will not cause us \add believers\add* to live again \f*, we might as well say \add as people often say\add*: "Tomorrow we are going to die, so we might as well enjoy now everything that we can. We might as well feast and get drunk!"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 My brothers and sisters, I am so proud of you; you are like my possessions that I show off to Christ Jesus our Lord. But I tell you that I die every day!
\v 32 If God will not raise the dead, then I fought with those wild animals at Ephesus for nothing. What the poets wrote would in that case be true: "Let us eat food and drink wine today, because we will die tomorrow."
