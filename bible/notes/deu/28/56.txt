\v 56 The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to put the bottom of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tendernessâ€”she will be envious of her own dear husband, of her son, and of her daughter,
\v 57 and of her own newborn that comes out from between her legs, and of the children whom she will bear. She will eat them in private for lack of anything else, during the siege and in the distress which your enemy will put upon you within your city gates.
