\v 3  If the second husband hates her and writes her a bill of divorce, puts it into her hand, and sends her out of his house; or if the second husband die, he who took her to be his wifeâ€”
\v 4 then her former husband, who had first sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after she has become impure; for that would be something disgusting to Yahweh. You must not cause the land to sin, the land that Yahweh your God is giving you as an inheritance.
