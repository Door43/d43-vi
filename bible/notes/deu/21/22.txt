\v 22 If a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and if he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree;
\v 23 his body must not remain all night on the tree. Instead, you must surely bury him the same day; for whoever is hanged is cursed by God. Obey this commandment so that you do not defile the land that Yahweh your God is giving you as an inheritance.
