\v 23 If there is a girl who is a virgin engaged to a man, and if another man find hers in the city and lies with her,
\v 24 then you must bring them both out to the city gate, and you must stone them to death with stones. You must stone the girl, because she did not cry out, although she was in the city. And you must stone the man, because he has humiliated the wife of a fellow Israelites. In this manner you must eradicate the evil from among you.
