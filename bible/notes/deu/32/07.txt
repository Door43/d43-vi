===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Call to mind** - AT: "Remember"
  * **days of ancient times** - "days of long ago." Moses refers to the time period when the ancestors of the people of Israel were alive.
  * **think about the years of many ages past** - This is a repetition of what Moses just said in the previous portion. Moses wants the people of Israel to focus on their history as a nation.
