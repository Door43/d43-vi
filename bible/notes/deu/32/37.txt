===== Translation Notes: =====
Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Where are their gods, the rock in whom they took refuge?** - Yahweh uses a question to mock his people who worshiped false gods. Yahweh uses the word "rock" because the people thought the false gods were strong and could protect them. AT: "Look, the gods the Israelites thought would protect them have not come to help them" (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings?** - Yahweh uses another question for the same reason. The gods did not really eat and drink. This means the Israelites offered meat and wine as sacrifices to the false gods. AT: "The gods to whom the Israelites offered meat and wine have not come to help them."
  * **Let them rise up and help you; let them be your protection** - Yahweh says this to mock the Israelites. He know these gods can do nothing to help them. AT: "These idols are not even able to get up and help or protect them" (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
