===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **They have acted corruptly** - "The Israelites have corrupted themselves"
  * **a perverted and crooked generation**  - This is saying the same thing in different ways to emphasize how wicked the generation is. AT: “a wicked people who do not honor God” (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Do you reward Yahweh in this way, you foolish and senseless people? Is he not your father, the one who has created you? he made you and established you.** - Moses uses questions to emphasize that the people have disobeyed and not been grateful for what God has done for them. AT: "Yahweh is your father and he made you a people, but you are foolish and you do not thank him." (See:[[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
