  * **he fed them the fruits of the field** - This means that Yahweh brought them to a land with lots of produce they could eat.
  * **He nourished him with honey from the rock and oil from the flinty crag** - The land had many wild bees with hives inside rock holes. And also olive trees, which grow on rocks, hills and mountains. AT: "He provided honey for them from the rock and oil from the stony ground"
