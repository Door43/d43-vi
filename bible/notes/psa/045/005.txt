<usfm>
\q
\v 5 Your arrows are sharp;
\q the peoples fall under you;
\q your arrows are in the hearts of the king’s enemies.
\q
\v 6 Your throne, God, is forever and ever;
\q a scepter of justice is the scepter of your kingdom.
\q
\v 7 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;
\q therefore God, your God, has anointed you
\q with the oil of gladness more than your companions.

  * **the peoples fall under you ... hearts of the king’s enemies** - This describes the king's enemies dying in battle. For AT see UDB. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **Your throne, God, is forever and ever** - The author turns his attention from the king and speaks to God. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]]) The word "throne" is used to refer to rule as a king. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) AT: "God you will rule on your throne forever and ever"
  * **forever and ever** - Both of these words have the same meaning.  They are used together for emphasis. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **You have loved** - The author returns to speaking to the king.
  * **oil of gladness** - Gladness is referred to as an oil that can be poured on a person. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
