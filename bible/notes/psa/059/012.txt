\v 12 Because what they say \f + \ft metonymy \f* is sinful,

\q2 and that you rule over all the earth.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Consume them in wrath, consume them so that they will be no more**  - These two phrases are saying the same thing. They are used together here for emphasis. David wants Yahweh to destroy his enemies completely. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
