\q
\v 3 The wicked are estranged from the womb;
\q they go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
\q
\v 4 Their poison is like a snakeâ€™s poison;
\q they are like the deaf adder that stops up its ears,
\q
\v 5 that pays no attention to the voice of charmers,
\q no matter how skillful they are.
