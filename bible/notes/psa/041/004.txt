\q 'When will he die and his name perish?'

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **heal my soul**  -  AT: "heal me" (UDB)
    * **his name perish** - If a person's name dies, it means that people forget that he had ever lived.  AT: "when will his name perish" or "when will people forget about him" (See [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **he says worthless things**  - AT: "they pretend to be concerned about me" (UDB) Note that the ULB uses a singular pronoun meaning one enemy.  The UDB uses a plural pronoun referring to any of his enemies.  
    * **his heart gathers up my disaster for itself**  - AT: "they eagerly listen to all the bad news about myself" (UDB) (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_singularpronouns]])
