  * **you went out before your people **- AT: " you led the people you chose to belong to you."
  * **the heavens also dropped rain ,,,,God's presence**  - This also could be translated "God caused it to rain."
  * **in the presence of God….the God of Israel**  - This means God was with his people when they arrived at Mt. Sinai. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
