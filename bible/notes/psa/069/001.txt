    * **the waters have come into my soul** - This phrase expresses a feeling of helplessness caused by the difficult situation or David was in. It was as if he was drowning. (See: Hyperbole) 
    * **mire**  - thick mud
    * **I sink in deep mire, where there is no place to stand**  - David continues to describe his feeling of helplessness and hopelessness.  It seems as if there is no way out of his troubles.
    * **I have come into deep waters, where the floods flow over me**  - This phrase is another way of saying that he feels hopeless and his problems appear to drown him
