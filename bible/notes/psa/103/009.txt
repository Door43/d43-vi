===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He will not always discipline; he is not always angry.** - These two phrases have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. Also, the author uses litotes to emphasize that God doesn't always discipline, but that he is merciful and that sometimes he is angry but often he is not angry. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **He does not deal with us ... or repay us ...** - These two phrases are parallel and emphasize that God does not punish us as we deserve.(See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
