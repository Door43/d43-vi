  * **maschil** - See how you translated this in [[vi:bible:notes:psa:042:001|42:1]].
  * **did in their days, in the days of old**  - Both of these phrases use the word "days" to refer to the time period when the ancestors of the people of Israel were alive. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **drove out the nations**  - "caused the people from other nations to leave"
  * **planted our people**  - The word "planted" compares when Yahweh gave Israel to his people as their home to putting a plants roots in the soil so it can grow there. (See: [[:vi:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
