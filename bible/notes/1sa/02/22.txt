\v 22 Now Eli was very old; he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
\v 23 He said to them, "Why do you such things? For I hear of your evil actions from all these people."
\v 24 No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear. You make Yahwehâ€™s people disobey.
