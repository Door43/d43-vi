\c 3
\p
\v 1 The child Samuel served Yahweh under Eli. Yahweh's word was rare in those days; there was no frequent prophetic vision.
\v 2 At that time, when Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see well, was lying down in his own bed, 
\v 3 The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down to sleep in the house of Yahweh, where the ark of God was.
\v 4 Yahweh called to Samuel, who said, "Here I am."
