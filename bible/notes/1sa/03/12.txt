\v 12 On that day I will carry out against Eli everything I have said about his house, from beginning to end.
\v 13 I have told him that I am about to judge his house once for all for the sin that he knew about, because his sons brought a
curse upon themselves and he did not stop them.
\v 14 Because of this I have sworn to the house of Eli that the sins of his house will never be atoned for by sacrifice
or offering."
