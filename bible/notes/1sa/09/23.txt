\v 23 Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion which I gave to you, of which I said to you, 'Put it aside.'" 
\v 24 So the cook took the thigh that had been raised in sacrifice and what was with it, and set it before Saul. Then
Samuel said, "See what has been kept for you! Eat it, because it has been kept until the appointed time for you. For now you can say, 'I have invited the people.'" So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
