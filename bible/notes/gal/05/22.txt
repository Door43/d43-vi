\v 22 But as we grow in trusting Christ, God's Spirit starts causing us to love others. We are joyful. We are peaceful. We are patient. We are kind. We are good. We are ones whom others can trust.
\v 23 We are gentle. We control our behavior. There is no law that says people should not think and act in such ways.
\v 24 Furthermore, we who belong to Christ Jesus have stopped obsessing over the evil things we wanted to do.
It is as though we had nailed them to a cross and killed these evil things!
