==== Choosing a Translation Platform ====

Now you need to select a translation and checking platform. This is where the translation and checking teams will do their work. There are four options: 

  * Online in a web browser - For those with consistent internet, they can work straight on door43. Click [[vi:ta:vol1:process:setup_door43|here]] to set up door43 for translation.
  * Offline on a mobile device - For those with access to an Android tablet or mobile device, they can work offline in our translation app called translationStudio. Click [[vi:ta:vol1:process:setup_tsandroid|here]] to set up translationStudio.
  * Offline in a word processor - For those who would like to work in a word processor, they download the files needed to do that. Click [[vi:ta:vol1:process:setup_word|here]] to set up word processor.
