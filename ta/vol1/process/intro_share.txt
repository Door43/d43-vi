===== Introduction to Distribution =====

This module answers the question: How can I distribute content?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[vi:ta:vol1:process:intro_publishing|Introduction to Publishing]]

==== Distribution Overview ====

Content is worthless unless it is disseminated and used. One advantage of using the Door43/unfoldingWord translation and publishing platform is that it provides multiple, simple ways of distributing both published and unpublished content. 

==== Open License ====

The biggest factor that encourages distribution of content is the [[vi:ta:vol1:intro:open_license|Open License]] that is used with all content on Door43 and unfoldingWord. This license gives everybody the freedom they need to:

   * Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
   * Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.

Under the terms of the license. 





Next we recommend you learn about:
