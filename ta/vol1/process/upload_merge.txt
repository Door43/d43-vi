To merge content uploaded by translationStudio:

  - On the right-hand side above the icon of the "Edit" pencil will appear an icon of two lines merging into one arrow which is labeled "Apply Updates". Click on "Apply Updates". 
  - Then you may go through and "Dismiss" or "Apply" changes on Door43. If you choose "Apply" it will overwrite what was on Door43 with what was uploaded, "Dismiss" discards what was uploaded and keeps what was on Door43.
