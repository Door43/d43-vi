===== Links in the Notes =====

This module answers the question: Why should I use the links in the Notes?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[vi:ta:vol1:translate:translate_help|Help with Translating]]
  * [[vi:ta:vol1:translate:resources_intro|Introduction to Resources]]

==== Repeated Phrases in a Book ====

Sometimes a phrase is used multiple times in one book. When this happens, there will be a link in the Notes - green chapter and verse numbers that you can click on - that will take you back to where you have translated that phrase before. This will make it easier for you to translate this phrase by reminding you of where you have already translated it. This will make your translation faster and more consistent because you will be reminded to translate that phrase in the same way each time. If a translation that you have used before for the same phrase does not fit a new context, then you will have to think of a new way to translate it. In this case, you should make a note of it and discuss it with others on the translation team. These links will only take you back to notes in the book that you are working on. 

=== Examples ===

  * **be fruitful and multiply** - See how you translated these commands in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:28|1:28]].
  * **everything that creeps along the ground** - This includes all types of small animals. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:24|1:25]].
  * **will be blessed in him** - AT: “will be blessed because of Abraham” or “will be blessed because  I have blessed Abraham.” For translating “in him,” see how you  translated “through you” in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:12:01|12:3]].
