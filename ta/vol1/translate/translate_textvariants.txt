==== Explanation ====

Some people who were making copies of Bible books added words or even whole sentences into the text that they copied. Sometimes this was to explain what was in the text and sometimes it was to add to the ideas in the text, often using phrases from other places in the Bible. Sometimes this happened accidentally, as the person copied something twice or included in the text a comment that someone else had written beside the text. Sometimes words were left out by accident, as well. But over all, the Bible books have been copied with great accuracy and faithfulness over many, many years. By comparing many different copies with each other, Bible scholars can decide which copies are accurate and which ones have errors.

Sometimes there will be a footnote with the ULB that says something like, “some ancient authorities add a verse here.” We recommend that the translator include this footnote when translating the passages where it appears in the ULB. For example, there will be a note like this at Mark 16:9-20 and at verses such as Acts 8:37 and 1 John 5:7-8. This means that some copies of the Bible have these verses, but others that are older and considered to be accurate do not.

The Bible student needs to be careful to look at the history of the added words and what Bible scholars say about them in order to determine whether they are likely to be from the original text. This requires a great deal of study. 

The verses in the New Testament that many scholars believe may not be original are these:
    Matthew 17:21; 18:11; 23:14
    Mark 7:16; 9:44,46; 11:26; 15:28; 16:9-20
    Luke 17:36; 23:17
    John 5:3b-4, 7:53-8:11
    Acts 8:37; 15:34; 24:6b-8a; 28:29
    Romans 16:24
    1 John 5:7-8

==== Translation Suggestions ====

We recommend that the Bible translator follow these guidelines when translating such passages:
  - Translators have a choice about which manuscripts to follow. They can translate as the ULB does, or if they prefer other Bibles that follow other manuscripts, they may follow them.
  - If translators follow the ULB, translating the verses that are there and not translating verses that are not in the ULB, they should also translate the footnotes that the ULB provides in those places.
  - If translators follow other manuscripts (for example, if they translate Acts 8:37 as part of their main text although the ULB does not include that verse), they may need to write their footnote differently, for example, “Some ancient authorities omit verse 37.”
