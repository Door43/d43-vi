===== Forms of You =====

This module answers the question: What are the different forms of you?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:

==== Singular / Dual / Plural ====

Some languages have more than one word for ‘you’ depending on how many people are being spoken to. If they are speaking to one person, they use the ‘singular’ form of "you." If they are speaking to more than one person, they use the "plural" form of "you." Some languages have a "dual" form for speaking to two people and some have other forms for speaking to three or four people. 

Watch the video for Singular / Dual / Plural [[http://youtu.be/cPtjzJ2Advk|computer]] (http://youtu.be/cPtjzJ2Advk) or the [[http://youtu.be/AVITfDEk8nc|tablet/phone]] (http://youtu.be/AVITfDEk8nc).

==== Formal / Informal ====

Some languages also have different forms of "you" to indicate respect or social distance. They use the formal form of "you" when addressing someone who is an elder or respected or in authority. They use the informal "you" when talking with a peer or someone with less authority. Because the Bible was written in languages that do not have this difference, the translator will need to decide when it is best to use formal or informal forms of the language.
