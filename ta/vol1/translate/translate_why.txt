==== Why Translate the Bible? ====

The Bible is the most influential book in history. It is God's message to mankind. Jesus commanded the Church to make disciples by teaching people from every nation to observe everything that is contained in it.

<blockquote>So go, and using my authority, teach my message to people of all ethnic groups so that they may become my disciples. Baptize them to be under the authority of my Father, and of me, his Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Teach them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember that I will be with you always, until the end of this age. -Matthew 28:19-20 (UDB)</blockquote>

The original Bible was written in ancient forms of the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek languages. Few people today understand any of those languages. Therefore, the Bible must be translated so they can read and understand it. People continue to translate the Bible into the languages of every people group so that God's message can change their lives.
