==== The Writing of the Original Manuscripts ====

The Bible was written many hundreds of years ago as God inspired his prophets and apostles in ancient times. The Old Testament books were written in Hebrew, with a few parts in Aramaic, the language that the people of Israel used as they lived in exile in Assyria and Babylon. The New Testament books were written in Greek, the language that was used for wider communication throughout the known world between 300 years before Christ and 300 years after Christ. The Old Testament was also translated into Greek about two to three hundred years before Christ.

Since there was no paper in those early days, these writings were put on specially prepared animal skins or a material woven of reeds. These writings were extremely important, so trained people copied them over and over by hand, with great care to be accurate and faithful to the original text that they were copying.

Over hundreds of years, people made very many copies of the Bible and these copies became spread throughout the ancient world. As the Bible was translated into other ancient languages such as Latin, the translators in various parts of the world used the copies that were available to them when they translated. Later, people began to collect these copies and compare them. While these copies were very much the same, some of them had small differences from each other.

To decide which copies were right at these places where there were small differences, Bible scholars decided that the oldest copies were better because they were closer to the originals. Where the more recent copies were different, the Bible scholars decided that these differences were either accidental errors made while copying or sometimes they were ideas put into the copies by people who were not copying in a strictly faithful manner. So, when we try to decide which copies are more reliable or trustworthy, we prefer the older ones and also we prefer the groups of copies that were made by people who followed a tradition that had a reputation for accuracy and faithfulness.
