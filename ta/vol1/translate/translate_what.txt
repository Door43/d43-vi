==== What Should I Start Translating? ====

We recommend that you begin by translating Open Bible Stories. There are many good reasons to start by translating Open Bible Stories:
  * Open Bible Stories was designed to be easily translated
    * It is largely narrative
    * Many difficult phrases and words have been substituted with words that are easier to translate
    * It has many pictures to help the translator understand the text
  * Open Bible Stories is much shorter than the Bible or even the New Testament, so it can be quickly completed and distributed to the Church
  * Since it is not Scripture, Open Bible Stories removes the fear that many translators have of translating the Word of God
  * Translating Open Bible Stories before translating the Bible gives the translators experience and training in translation, so that when they translate the 
  Bible, they will do it well
    * Experience in creating a translation and checking team
    * Experience in doing the translation and checking process
    * Experience in using the Unfolding Word translation tools
    * Experience in resolving translation conflicts
    * Experience in getting church and community participation
    * Experience in publishing and distributing content
  * Open Bible Stories is a great tool to teach the church, evangelize the lost, and train the translators in what the Bible is all about

You can work your way through the Stories in whatever order that you want, but we have found [[https://door43.org/en/obs/31|Story #31]] is a good first story to translate since it is short and easy to understand.

After completing Open Bible Stories, we encourage the translation team to start translating the Bible. We highly recommend starting with books that are largely narrative (like Ruth or the Gospel of Mark) and saving the more difficult, theologically "heavy" books (like Romans and Galatians) until much later in the translation process.
