====== beast ======

===== Facts: =====

In the Bible, the term "beast" is often just another way of saying "animal."

  * A "wild beast" is a type of animal that lives freely in the forest or fields and has not been trained by people.
  * A domestic beast is an animal that lives with people and is kept for food or for performing work, such as plowing. Often the term "livestock" is used to refer to this kind of animal.
  * The Old Testament book of Daniel and the New Testament book of Revelation describe visions in which metaphorical beasts represent evil powers and authorities that oppose God.  (See: [[:vi:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metaphor]])]
