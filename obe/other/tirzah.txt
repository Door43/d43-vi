====== Tirzah ======

===== Facts: =====

Tirzah was an important Canaanite city and later became one of the temporary capital cities of the northern Kingdom of Israel.

  * The city Tirzah was located in the region occupied by the tribe of Manasseh. The city is thought to have been about 10 miles north of the city of Shechem.
  * Tirzah was also the name of one of Manasseh's grand-daughters who asked for an inheritance in the land since they had no brothers to inherit it, as was the normal custom.
