====== law, law of Moses, God's law, law of Yahweh ======

===== Definition: =====

The terms, "law" and "law of Moses" refer generally to all the commandments and instructions that God gave Moses for the people of Israel to obey. Other ways of referring to these laws include, "law of Yahweh" or "God's law" or "law of God."

  * Depending on the context, the "law" can refer to:
      * the Ten Commandments that God wrote on stone tablets for the Israelites.
      * all the laws given to Moses
      * the first five books of the Old Testament.
      * the entire Old Testament (also referred to as "scriptures" in the New Testament).
      * all of God's instructions and will.
  * Sometimes the phrase "the law and the prophets" is used to refer to the Old Testament.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Since there are many instructions, some translations may prefer to translate this in the plural and say, "laws."
  * The "law of Moses" could be translated as "the laws that God told Moses to give to the Israelites."
  * Depending on the context, "the law of Moses" can also be translated as "the law that Moses wrote" or "God's laws that Moses wrote down" or "the laws that God told Moses to give to the Israelites."
  * Ways to translate "the law" or "law of God" or "God's laws" could include: "laws from God" or "God's commands" or "laws that God gave" or "everything that God commanded" or "God's rules" or "the laws that God commanded."
  * The phrase, "law of Yahweh" could also be translated as, "Yahweh's laws" or "laws that Yahweh said to obey" or "laws from Yahweh" or "things Yahweh commanded." (Also see translation suggestions above for "law of God" and "God's laws".)
